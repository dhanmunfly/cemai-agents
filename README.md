# CemAI Agents - Autonomous Cement Plant Optimization System

## Overview

The CemAI Agent Swarm is an enterprise-grade, intelligent agent system designed as the central nervous system for autonomous cement plant operations. It functions as a collaborative digital expert team that continuously monitors, predicts, and optimizes plant operations to drive measurable improvements in efficiency, quality, and sustainability.

## Architecture

### Agent Hierarchy
- **Master Control Agent** ("The Conductor") - Brain and coordinator of the swarm
- **Guardian Agent** ("The Stabilizer") - Process stability and quality assurance
- **Optimizer Agent** ("The Economist") - Cost optimization and sustainability
- **Egress Agent** ("The Actuator") - Secure command transmission to OPC-UA

### Technology Stack
- **Cloud Platform**: Google Cloud Platform
- **Compute**: Cloud Run (serverless)
- **AI/ML**: Vertex AI (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Forecasting, Optimization)
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph for stateful multi-agent workflows
- **Database**: AlloyDB for state persistence
- **Messaging**: Pub/Sub for event-driven communication
- **Security**: VPC Service Controls, IAM, Private Service Connect

## Key Features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Google Cloud Platform project with required APIs enabled
- Docker for containerization
- Terraform for infrastructure deployment
- Python 3.11+ for agent development

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cemai-agents
   ```

2. **Configure GCP Authentication**
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
   ```

3. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/terraform
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Build and Deploy Agents**
   ```bash
   # Each agent can be built and deployed independently
   cd agents/guardian
   docker build -t guardian-agent .
   gcloud run deploy guardian-agent --source .
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Agent Development Principles
1. **Microservice Architecture**: Each agent is an independent, containerized service
2. **Stateful Workflows**: Use LangGraph for complex, multi-step reasoning
3. **Security First**: Implement least-privilege access and authenticated communication
4. **Observability**: Instrument all operations for tracing and monitoring

### Communication Protocols
- All inter-agent communication uses standardized A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocols
- Authentication required for all service-to-service calls
- Structured proposal format for decision coordination

## Security Model

### Zero-Trust Architecture
- Each agent runs with dedicated IAM service account
- All communication authenticated and encrypted
- Network isolation via VPC Service Controls
- Single egress point for plant system communication

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for all operations
- Human approval gates for critical decisions

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics
- Decision latency (target: <60 seconds)
- Recommendation acceptance rate (target: >95%)
- System uptime (target: 99.95%)
- Economic impact tracking

### Tracing & Debugging
- End-to-end request tracing with Cloud Trace
- Structured logging for AI decision processes
- Performance metrics and alerting
- Audit trail for all decisions
