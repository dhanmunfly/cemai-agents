## Monitoring and Alerting

### Automated Bug Detection
```yaml
# Error rate alerts
- name: "High Error Rate"
  condition: "error_rate > 1%"
  severity: "P1"
  auto_create_ticket: true

# Performance degradation
- name: "Decision Latency High"
  condition: "decision_latency > 120s"
  severity: "P1" 
  auto_create_ticket: true

# Security issues
- name: "Authentication Failures"
  condition: "auth_failures > 10/minute"
  severity: "P0"
  auto_create_ticket: true
```

### Log Analysis for Bug Detection
```python
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BugDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.error_patterns = [
            r'ERROR.*(?:exception|error|failed)',
            r'CRITICAL.*(?:timeout|connection)',
            r'SECURITY.*(?:unauthorized|breach)',
        ]
    
    def analyze_logs(self, log_entries):
        """Analyze logs for potential bugs"""
        issues = []
        for entry in log_entries:
            for pattern in self.error_patterns:
                if re.search(pattern, entry, re.IGNORECASE):
                    issues.append(self.create_issue(entry))
        return issues
    
    def create_issue(self, log_entry):
        """Create issue from log entry"""
        return {
            'severity': self.determine_severity(log_entry),
            'description': self.extract_description(log_entry),
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow(),
            'source': 'automated_detection'
        }
```

## Quality Assurance Process

### Pre-deployment Testing
```bash
# Comprehensive test suite
pytest tests/ -v --cov=agents --cov-min-percentage=90

# Security testing
bandit -r agents/ -f json -o security_report.json

# Performance testing
locust -f tests/load/test_decision_latency.py --users=100

# Integration testing
pytest tests/integration/ -v --timeout=300
```

### Post-deployment Monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Continuous agent health monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time latency and throughput tracking
- **Business Metrics**: KPI monitoring for optimization effectiveness
- **Error Tracking**: Automatic error detection and alerting

## Bug Resolution Workflow

### Development Process
1. **Branch Creation**: `git checkout -b fix/bug-description`
2. **Fix Implementation**: Address root cause with comprehensive testing
3. **Code Review**: Peer review focusing on fix effectiveness and side effects
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite including regression tests
5. **Staging Deployment**: Deploy to staging for validation
6. **Production Deployment**: Gradual rollout with monitoring

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Immediate rollback for critical issues
gcloud run services update-traffic SERVICE_NAME \
  --to-revisions=STABLE_VERSION=100 \
  --region=us-central1

# Database rollback (if needed)
gcloud sql backups restore BACKUP_ID \
  --restore-instance=TARGET_INSTANCE

# Configuration rollback
terraform apply -var-file=previous_config.tfvars
```
